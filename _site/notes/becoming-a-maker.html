We fail to learn some smart tricks they use in their daily life, which makes their days a lot more productive than ours. My inspiration is the learning to question. Only when I started getting more curious did I start learning. So, it’s like the circle of life.</p><blockquote><p><em>Learn to question and question to learn.</em></p></blockquote><p>That was <em>quite</em> intense.</p><h2 id="launch-sequence-initiated">Launch Sequence Initiated</h2><p>With a lot of help from what I thought was Magic, the Internet, and my cool developer friend, I started following a course called CS101 by Stanford and for the next 6 weeks where I tried to spend about an hour or so everyday on it (which did not happen so it extended by a couple more weeks).</p><h3 id="some-cool-shiz-about-cs101">Some cool shiz about CS101</h3><p><em>I might get emotional writing this, readers caution advised.</em></p><blockquote><p><em>Me and code? You must be kidding!</em> <em>I don’t even know how the Internet works!</em></p></blockquote><p>The CS101 course by Stanford is designed <strong>exactly</strong> for people who have ever said anything like that. I was convinced for life that the internet was some kind of voodoo and that I’m never going to be able to decipher it.</p><p>Coding was a far-fetched reality. I would always have a question mark on my face when I’m amongst a group of developers(mostly men) who bitch about their bugs more than their girl friends (I’m lying, these guys had no girl friends. <strong><em>JK!!!</em></strong>)</p><p>Okay, I’ll come back to my point.</p><p>This simple course helped me understand how I’m able to watch endless number of videos on YouTube, how I send and receive images through WhatsApp, what makes all this work - code, how we’re able to share data when we’re within the same network (of course, what is a bloody network!), what makes a computer <strong>FAST</strong>, storing of data, compression - we all talk about compressing files but I never knew it was so simple, how malware attacks our computers and everything I ever thought was beyond my brain’s processing capacity!</p><blockquote><p><em>IT BLEW MY MIND!</em></p></blockquote><h3 id="what-is-my-biggest-learning">What is my biggest learning?</h3><p>If I ever feel that something is beyond my understanding, I would not say it before I attempted to learn it. Of course it’s not practical to think that we would understand everything (why not!) but we can’t take them on their face value.</p><ul><li>My First Bicycle Ride</li><li>My First Dive into the Pool</li><li>My First Airplane Ride</li><li>My First Beer</li><li>My First Long Distance Solo Drive</li></ul><h2 id="my-first-git-project">My First Git Project</h2><p>Adding to the list above is this one too - My first Git Project!
