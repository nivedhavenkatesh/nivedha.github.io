Becoming a Maker
================

## Pre-Launch
We often overlook the people who are around us. We fail to learn some smart tricks they use in their daily life, which makes their days a lot more productive than ours. My inspiration is the learning to question. Only when I started getting more curious did I start learning. So, it's like the circle of life.

>Learn to question and question to learn.

That was *quite* intense.

## Launch Sequence Initiated
With a lot of help from what I thought was Magic, the Internet, and my cool developer friend, I started following a course called CS101 by Stanford and for the next 6 weeks where I tried to spend about an hour or so everyday on it (which did not happen so it extended by a couple more weeks).

### Some cool shiz about CS101
*I might get emotional writing this, readers caution advised.*
> Me and code? You must be kidding!
>I don't even know how the Internet works!

The CS101 course by Stanford is designed **exactly** for people who have ever said anything like that. I was convinced for life that the internet was some kind of voodoo and that I'm never going to be able to decipher it.

Coding was a far-fetched reality. I would always have a question mark on my face when I'm amongst a group of developers(moslty men) who bitch about their bugs more than their girl friends (I'm lieing, these guys had no girl friends. **_JK!!!_**)

Okay, I'll come back to my point.

This simple course helped me understand how I'm able to watch endless number of videos on YouTube, how I send and recieve images through Whatsapp, what makes all this work - code, how we're able to share data when we're within the same network (of course, what is a bloody network!), what makes a computer **FAST**, storing of data, compression - we all talk about compressing files but I never knew it was so simple, how malware attacks our computers and everything I ever thought was beyond my brain's processing capacity!

> IT BLEW MY MIND!

### What is my biggest learning?
If I ever feel that something is beyond my understanding, I would not say it before I attempted to learn it. Of course it's not practical to think that we would understand everything (why not!) but we can't take them on their face value.

## My First Git Project

Adding to the list above is this one too - My first Git Project! YES. I HAVE MY OWN GITHUB HANDLE NOW! Say whaaaaaat!

To think of it now, if I had imagined either one of these to be beyond my understanding or capabilities, I would sit to think how stupid I was to have not taken that one step forward before letting my fear take over.

For any of you out there who think tech is complicated AF, read this again.
